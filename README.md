# AwsLogAnalyser
## What is this tool for
This tool is designed to analyze logs exported from AWS in Json format with a graphical interface. It helps identify suspicious activities. The tool is still in the testing phase but can already be used.

## Why this tool
I originally created this tool to assist me in investigative challenges on HackTheBox (such as Nubilum 1 and Nubilum 2). Not finding similar tools, I decided to code one myself.

## How it works
When opening the program, you need to select a directory containing log files in .json format (the program will search in its subdirectories to find all json files). The program will take some time to load certain data. You can then access different tabs:

### Events
The Event tab allows you to create filters and display corresponding events. You can also filter events by date. The program will automatically suggest known keys and values as you complete the fields.

### Statistics
The Statistics tab displays statistics related to specific data. For example, you can show the percentage of events generated by each source IP address.

### Errors
The Errors tab simply lists errors present in the logs.

### Alerts
The Alerts tab displays potentially malicious IP addresses. Additionally, you can find the user accounts that these IP addresses accessed, as well as the IAM policies created by these IP addresses.
